curses-menu
===========

This is a fork of https://github.com/pmbarrett314/curses-menu. It has been altered to make one change:


``menu.append(item, hotkey="a")``



The hotkey will allow instant execution of the menu item by pressing the specified key (supplied here as a string for convenience).

For everything else see the original docs: http://curses-menu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
